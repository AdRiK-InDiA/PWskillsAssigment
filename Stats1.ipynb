    "What are Types of Data in Statistics?\n",
    "The data is classified into majorly four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal data\n",
    "2. Ordinal data\n",
    "3. Discrete data\n",
    "4. Continuous data\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative or Categorical Data\n",
    "Qualitative data, also known as the categorical data, describes the data that fits into the categories. Qualitative data are not numerical. The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes categorical data can hold numerical values (quantitative value), but those values do not have a mathematical sense. Examples of the categorical data are birthdate, favourite sport, school postcode. Here, the birthdate and school postcode hold the quantitative value, but it does not give numerical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal Data\n",
    "Nominal data is one of the types of qualitative information which helps to label the variables without providing the numerical value. Nominal data is also called the nominal scale. It cannot be ordered and measured. But sometimes, the data can be qualitative and quantitative. Examples of nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal data are examined using the grouping method. In this method, the data are grouped into categories, and then the frequency or the percentage of the data can be calculated. These data are visually represented using the pie charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data\n",
    "Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. The significant feature of the nominal data is that the difference between the data values is not determined. This variable is mostly found in surveys, finance, economics, questionnaires, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinal data is commonly represented using a bar chart. These data are investigated and interpreted through many visualisation tools. The information may be expressed using tables in which each row in the table shows the distinct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative or Numerical Data\n",
    "Quantitative data is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often, how many). Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are height, length, size, weight, and so on. The quantitative data can be classified into two different types based on the data sets. The two different classifications of numerical data are discrete data and continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Data\n",
    "Discrete data can take only discrete values. Discrete information contains only a finite number of possible values. Those values cannot be subdivided meaningfully. Here, things can be counted in whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Number of students in the class\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Data\n",

    "Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set (e.g., height or test scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 levels of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nominal: the data can only be categorized\n",
    "2. Ordinal: the data can be categorized and ranked\n",
    "3. Interval: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced\n",
    "4. Ratio: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.\n",
    "5. Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze your data may be limited. There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal scale simply categorizes variables according to qualitative labels (or names). These labels and groupings don’t have any order or hierarchy to them, nor do they convey any numerical value. For example, the variable “hair color” could be measured on a nominal scale according to the following categories: blonde hair, brown hair, gray hair, and so on. Learn more in this complete guide to nominal data.\n",
    "The ordinal scale also categorizes variables into labeled groups, and these categories have an order or hierarchy to them. For example, you could measure the variable “income” on an ordinal scale as follows: low income, medium income, high income. Another example could be level of education, classified as follows: high school, master’s degree, doctorate. These are still qualitative labels (as with the nominal scale), but you can see that they follow a hierarchical order. Learn more in this guide to ordinal data.\n",
    "The interval scale is a numerical scale which labels and orders variables, with a known, evenly spaced interval between each of the values. An oft-cited example of interval data is temperature in Fahrenheit, where the difference between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit is exactly the same as the difference between, say, 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Learn more about interval data in this guide.\n",
    "The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale, with one key difference: The ratio scale has what’s known as a “true zero.” A good example of ratio data is weight in kilograms. If something weighs zero kilograms, it truly weighs nothing—compared to temperature (interval data), where a value of zero degrees doesn’t mean there is “no temperature,” it simply means it’s extremely cold! You’ll find a full guide to ratio data here.\n"

    "### 1. What are levels of measurement in data and statistics?\n",
    "When gathering data, you collect different types of information, depending on what you hope to investigate or find out. For example, if you wanted to analyze the spending habits of people living in Tokyo, you might send out a survey to 500 people asking questions about their income, their exact location, their age, and how much they spend on various products and services. These are your variables: data that can be measured and recorded, and whose values will differ from one individual to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about levels of measurement, we’re talking about how each variable is measured, and the mathematical nature of the values assigned to each variable. This, in turn, determines what type of analysis can be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine you want to gather data relating to people’s income. There are various levels of measurement you could use for this variable. You could ask people to provide an exact figure, or you could ask them to select their answer from a variety of ranges—for example: (a) 10-19k, (b) 20-29k, (c) 30-39k, and so on. You could ask them to simply categorize their income as “high,” “medium,” or “low.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you see how these levels vary in their precision? If you ask participants for an exact figure, you can calculate just how much the incomes vary across your entire dataset (for example). However, if you only have classifications of “high,” “medium,” and “low,” you can’t see exactly how much one participant earns compared to another. You also have no concept of what salary counts as “high” and what counts as “low”—these classifications have no numerical value. Thus, the latter is a less precise level of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a nutshell: Level of measurement refers to how precisely a variable has been measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why are levels of measurement important?\n",
    "Level of measurement is important as it determines the type of statistical analysis you can carry out. As a result, it affects both the nature and the depth of insights you’re able to glean from your data. Certain statistical tests can only be performed where more precise levels of measurement have been used, so it’s essential to plan in advance how you’ll gather and measure your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are the four levels of measurement? Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales explained\n",
    "There are four levels of measurement (or scales) to be aware of: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Each scale builds upon the last, meaning that each scale not only “ticks the same boxes” as the previous scale, but also adds another level of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four levels of measurement displayed in a table: Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio So:\n",
    "\n",
    "The nominal scale simply categorizes variables according to qualitative labels (or names). These labels and groupings don’t have any order or hierarchy to them, nor do they convey any numerical value. For example, the variable “hair color” could be measured on a nominal scale according to the following categories: blonde hair, brown hair, gray hair, and so on. Learn more in this complete guide to nominal data.\n",
    "The ordinal scale also categorizes variables into labeled groups, and these categories have an order or hierarchy to them. For example, you could measure the variable “income” on an ordinal scale as follows: low income, medium income, high income. Another example could be level of education, classified as follows: high school, master’s degree, doctorate. These are still qualitative labels (as with the nominal scale), but you can see that they follow a hierarchical order. Learn more in this guide to ordinal data.\n",
    "The interval scale is a numerical scale which labels and orders variables, with a known, evenly spaced interval between each of the values. An oft-cited example of interval data is temperature in Fahrenheit, where the difference between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit is exactly the same as the difference between, say, 50 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Learn more about interval data in this guide.\n",
    "The ratio scale is exactly the same as the interval scale, with one key difference: The ratio scale has what’s known as a “true zero.” A good example of ratio data is weight in kilograms. If something weighs zero kilograms, it truly weighs nothing—compared to temperature (interval data), where a value of zero degrees doesn’t mean there is “no temperature,” it simply means it’s extremely cold! You’ll find a full guide to ratio data here.\n",
    "Another way to think about levels of measurement is in terms of the relationship between the values assigned to a given variable. With the nominal scale, there is no relationship between the values; there is no relationship between the categories “blonde hair” and “black hair” when looking at hair color, for example. The ratio scale, on the other hand, is very telling about the relationship between variable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your variable is “number of clients” (which constitutes ratio data), you know that a value of four clients is double the value of two clients. As such, you can get a much more accurate and precise understanding of the relationship between the values in mathematical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, there is an implied hierarchy to the four levels of measurement. Analysis of nominal and ordinal data tends to be less sensitive, while interval and ratio scales lend themselves to more complex statistical analysis. With that in mind, it’s generally preferable to work with interval and ratio data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’ve introduced the four levels of measurement, let’s take a look at each level in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Nominal level\n",
    "A definition of nominal data with examples and a brief summary of how it's analyzed\n",
    "What is the nominal level?\n",
    "The nominal level is the first level of measurement, and the simplest. It classifies and labels variables qualitatively. In other words, it divides them into named groups without any quantitative meaning. It’s important to note that, even where numbers are used to label different categories, these numbers don’t have any numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: If you collected data on hair color, when entering your data into a spreadsheet, you might use the number 1 to represent blonde hair, the number 2 to represent gray hair, and so on. These numbers are just labels; they don’t convey any mathematical meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the nominal scale, bear in mind that there is no order to the groups you use to classify your variable. One category is not higher than, better than, or greater than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of nominal data\n",
    "Some examples of nominal data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eye color (e.g. blue, brown, green)\n",
    "Nationality (e.g. German, Cameroonian, Lebanese)\n",
    "Personality type (e.g. introvert, extrovert, ambivert)\n",
    "Employment status (e.g. unemployed, part-time, retired)\n",
    "Political party voted for in the last election (e.g. party X, party Y, party Z)\n",
    "Type of smartphone owned (e.g. iPhone, Samsung, Google Pixel)\n",
    "As you can see, nominal data describes certain attributes or characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to analyze nominal data\n",
    "### 5. Descriptive statistics for nominal data\n",
    "Descriptive statistics describe or summarize the characteristics of your dataset. Two useful descriptive statistics for nominal data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency distribution\n",
    "Mode\n",
    "A frequency distribution table (e.g. a pivot table) summarizes how many responses there were for each category—for example, how many people selected “brown hair,” how many selected “blonde,” and so on. You can also use percentages rather than count, in which case your table will show you what percentage of the overall sample has what color hair."
